# Unsupervised Learning

### These projects are about Unsupervised Learning Technique, one of the three branches of machine learning.

**Supervised Learning** - you start with a label or a value that you are trying to predict.

**Unsupervised Learning** - you start grouping data together that does not have labels.

All of these projects work on the same unlabeld data "data.csv" that are already scaled.
